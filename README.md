# Lung Cancer Detection and Explainability

## Author
**Hailemicael Yimer**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting lung cancer from CT scan images using deep learning, along with advanced explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret the model's decisions. It includes:
- **Lung segmentation** to isolate relevant areas.
- **Tumor detection** in CT slices.
- **Visualization of training history**.
- **Explainability** through XAI methods for model interpretation.
